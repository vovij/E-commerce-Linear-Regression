# Linear Regression for E-commerce customer spending

This project showcases a linear regression implementation in Python, inspired by the tutorial [Linear Regression in Python - Full Project for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2Cw82YR5Bo) by [Alejandro AO - Software & AI](https://www.youtube.com/@alejandro_ao). The goal was to recreate the project to solidify understanding of linear regression implementation.

### Overview

- Data Exploration: Loaded and examined an e-commerce dataset to understand its structure and key features.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Created visualizations to explore relationships between variables such as 'Time on Website', 'Time on App', and 'Length of Membership' with 'Yearly Amount Spent'.

- Model Training and Evaluation: Trained a linear regression model, made predictions, and evaluated performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error.

- Residual Analysis: Analyzed residuals to assess model accuracy and fit.
